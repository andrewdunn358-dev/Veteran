## Review Notes for Apple

Include in the review notes:

"Radio Check is a peer support app for UK military veterans. The AI chat feature uses OpenAI's API to provide supportive conversation – these are NOT therapy or medical advice, which we clearly state in our Terms of Service and in-app disclaimers.

Our safeguarding system monitors for crisis indicators and can connect users with real helplines (Samaritans, Combat Stress) or human staff if needed.
