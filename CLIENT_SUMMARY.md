# Veterans Support App - Project Accomplishments
## Client Summary Report - February 2026

---

### Overview
Your veterans support application has received significant enhancements focused on **user safety**, **staff efficiency**, and **data security**. Below is a summary of what has been delivered.

---

## 1. AI Chatbot Safety System ("Battle Buddies")

### What We Built
- **Two AI companions** (Tommy & Doris) that veterans can chat with anonymously
- **Intelligent crisis detection** that recognizes when someone may need urgent help
- **Automatic safety interventions** when concerning language is detected

### How It Helps Veterans
- Provides a judgment-free first point of contact
- Offers 24/7 availability for those who aren't ready to talk to a human
- Gently guides users toward professional support when needed
- Captures location data (with consent) to help staff respond to emergencies

---

## 2. Live Chat Handover System

### What We Built
- Seamless transition from AI chat to live human support
- Real-time chat between veterans and staff members
- Alert system that notifies ALL available staff (counsellors AND peer supporters)
- Staff can "claim" chats so veterans get the fastest response

### How It Helps
- No veteran in crisis is left waiting
- Staff see alerts immediately with sound notifications
- Multiple staff can be online, and anyone available can respond

---

## 3. Staff Portal Improvements

### New Dashboard Layout
- **Side-by-side view**: Safeguarding alerts and Live Chats on the left, Callbacks and Notes on the right
- **No more scrolling**: Everything visible at a glance
- **Real-time alerts**: Sound and visual notifications for new events

### Staff Features
- Both Counsellors AND Peer Supporters can now handle live chats
- Status management (Available/Busy/Off Duty)
- Panic button for peers to escalate to counsellors
- Shared notes system for team collaboration

---

## 4. Callback System Enhancements

### Improvements Made
- **Optional email field** - users can provide email for follow-up
- **Message field** - users can describe their situation before the call
- **Confirmation screen** - users see "Request Sent" feedback
- **Staff notifications** - team is alerted to new callback requests

---

## 5. Friends & Family Support Section

### New Resources Added
- **Substance & Alcohol Support**
  - Tom Harrison House (veteran-specific rehab)
  - Alcoholics Anonymous, FRANK helpline, Drinkline
  
- **Criminal Justice Support**

  - Walking With The Wounded
  - Veterans' Gateway

### Why This Matters
- Families often notice problems before veterans seek help themselves
- Provides clear pathways for concerned loved ones to get guidance

## 6. Security Hardening

### Data Protection Measures
- **Encrypted sensitive data**: Names, phone numbers, emails, and messages are now encrypted in the database
- **Protected API endpoints**: Staff contact information is no longer publicly accessible
- **Role-based access**: Only authorized staff can view sensitive information

### What This Means
- Even if someone gained database access, they couldn't read personal information
- Compliance with data protection best practices
- Veterans' privacy is protected

---

## 7. Safeguarding Alert Enhancements

### New Capabilities
- **IP-based location tracking**: Helps identify approximate location for emergency response
