"""
Radio Check - Enhanced Safety Layer
====================================
Version 2.0 - February 2026

This module provides comprehensive safety monitoring that WRAPS AROUND
existing AI personas without altering their personalities.

Key Features:
1. Contextual Crisis Detection (beyond keyword matching)
2. Dependency & Over-reliance Safeguards
3. Age-appropriate Safeguards
4. Long-conversation Safety Erosion Protection
5. Formal Safety Logging
6. Hard Fail-safe Rules

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Safety logic enhances the system - it does NOT replace persona authenticity.
