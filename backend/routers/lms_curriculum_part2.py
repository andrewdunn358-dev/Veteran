## Substance Misuse and Addiction

Substance misuse is common among veterans. This module helps you understand addiction, recognise the signs, and provide appropriate peer support.

---

## Understanding Substance Misuse

### What is Substance Misuse?
Using substances (alcohol, drugs) in ways that cause harm to the person or those around them.

### Spectrum of Use:
- **Experimental**: Trying something once
- **Recreational**: Occasional social use
- **Problematic**: Use causing harm
- **Dependent**: Physical/psychological need

### Common Substances:
- **Alcohol**: Most common in veterans
- **Cannabis**: Often used for sleep/anxiety
- **Painkillers**: From service injuries
- **Cocaine/stimulants**: For energy/mood
- **Prescription medications**: Misused benzos, etc.

---

## Why Veterans Are at Risk

### Contributing Factors:
- **Drinking culture**: Normalised in military
- **Self-medication**: For PTSD, pain, sleep
- **Transition stress**: Major life change
- **Physical injuries**: Chronic pain
- **Loss of structure**: Less routine
- **Availability**: Mess culture
- **Coping mechanism**: Learned in service

### Statistics:
- Veterans are 2x more likely to have alcohol problems
- Heavy drinking often masks mental health issues
- Substance use increases suicide risk

---

## Signs of Problematic Use

### Behavioural Signs:
- Drinking/using more than intended
- Failed attempts to cut down
- Spending lots of time obtaining/using/recovering
- Neglecting responsibilities
- Continuing despite problems
- Giving up activities
- Using in dangerous situations
- Needing more to get the same effect (tolerance)
- Withdrawal symptoms when stopping

### Physical Signs:
- Changes in appearance
- Weight changes
- Sleep problems
- Tremors
- Bloodshot eyes
- Slurred speech

### Social Signs:
- Relationship problems
- Financial difficulties
- Work problems
- Legal issues
- Isolation

---

## Supporting Someone with Substance Issues

### DO:
- **Express concern without judgment**: "I've noticed... I'm worried about you"
- **Listen**: Understand their experience
- **Separate the person from the behaviour**: They're not a "bad person"
- **Encourage professional help**: Addiction services exist
- **Be patient**: Recovery is rarely linear
- **Celebrate small wins**: Every step matters
- **Look after yourself**: Set boundaries

### DON'T:
- Lecture or moralise
- Enable the behaviour (covering up, giving money)
- Give ultimatums unless you mean them
- Expect immediate change
- Take relapse personally
- Try to control their use
- Pour away their substances

### Helpful Things to Say:
- "I care about you and I'm worried"
- "You don't have to face this alone"
- "Would you be willing to talk to someone about this?"
- "What would help right now?"
- "I'm here for you"

---

## Understanding Addiction

### Addiction is a Brain Condition
Addiction changes brain chemistry. It's not simply a choice or moral failing.

- The brain's reward system is hijacked
- Withdrawal causes real physical pain
- Cravings can be overwhelming
- Willpower alone is often not enough

### Dual Diagnosis
Many people with substance problems also have mental health conditions:
- Using substances to cope with symptoms
- Substances making mental health worse
- Both need to be addressed

---

## Treatment Options

### Professional Help:
- **GP**: First point of contact
- **Drug and alcohol services**: Specialist support
- **Detox programmes**: Medical withdrawal support
- **Residential rehab**: Intensive treatment
- **Counselling**: Talking therapies

### Veteran-Specific:
- **Tom Harrison House**: Veteran addiction charity
- **Combat Stress**: Address trauma underlying addiction
- **Forward Assist**: Veteran wellbeing

### Mutual Aid Groups:
- **Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)**: 12-step programme
- **Narcotics Anonymous (NA)**: For drug users
- **SMART Recovery**: Alternative approach
- **Veteran-specific groups**: Some AA meetings are veteran-only

---

## Harm Reduction

If someone isn't ready to stop, harm reduction helps reduce risk:

### For Alcohol:
- Drink water between drinks
- Eat before drinking
- Count drinks
- Avoid rounds
- Don't drink alone
- Avoid mixing with drugs

### For Drugs:
- Don't use alone
- Know what you're taking
- Start with smaller amounts
- Don't mix substances
- Carry naloxone if using opioids

**Note:** You can share harm reduction information without endorsing use.

## CRITICAL MODULE - 100% Pass Required

Safeguarding is about protecting people from harm and abuse. As a peer supporter, you may receive disclosures or notice concerns. This module teaches you what to do.

---

## Receiving a Disclosure

Someone may tell you they are being abused or harmed. How you respond matters.

### DO:
- **Listen calmly**: Give them your full attention
- **Believe them**: Take what they say seriously
- **Reassure them**: "Thank you for telling me", "It's not your fault"
- **Don't promise confidentiality**: Explain you may need to tell someone
- **Don't ask leading questions**: Let them tell you in their own words
- **Record what they said**: As close to their words as possible
- **Report**: Follow Radio Check safeguarding procedures

### DON'T:
- React with shock or disbelief
- Promise to keep it secret
- Ask probing questions or investigate
- Confront the alleged abuser
- Promise things you can't guarantee
- Delay reporting

### What to Say:
- "Thank you for trusting me with this"
- "I believe you"
- "It's not your fault"
- "I need to share this with someone who can help keep you safe"
- "I'm going to do everything I can to help"

---

## When to Report

### Always Report:
- Any disclosure of abuse
- Concerns about a child's safety
- Concerns about a vulnerable adult
- Suspicion of abuse (you don't need proof)
- Immediate risk of harm

### Reporting Doesn't Mean:
- You need to be certain
- You need to have proof
- The person has to agree
- You're getting someone in trouble

**It's NOT your job to investigate. Report your concerns.**

---

## How to Report

### Immediate Danger:
**Call 999** if someone is in immediate risk of harm.

### Radio Check Procedure:
1. Contact your Radio Check supervisor immediately
2. Document what you know (who, what, when, where)
3. Use the person's own words where possible
4. Note your concerns and reasons
5. Don't delay - report promptly

### If You Can't Reach Supervisor:
- Local authority safeguarding team
- Police (101 for non-emergency, 999 for emergency)
- NSPCC Helpline (for children): 0808 800 5000

---

## Recording Concerns

### What to Record:
- Date and time of disclosure/concern
- Who is involved (victim, alleged perpetrator)
- What was said/observed (in their words)
- Any visible injuries
- Your actions taken
- Who you reported to

### Important:
- Record facts, not opinions
- Use the person's words, not interpretations
- Be objective
- Keep records confidential
- Don't share with unauthorised people

---

## Safeguarding Children

### Your Responsibilities:
- Report any concerns about children
- Don't need to investigate - just report
- Child's welfare is paramount

### Remember:
- A child is anyone under 18
- Even if a child asks you not to tell, you must report
- It's always better to be wrong than to miss abuse

---

## Domestic Abuse

### Recognising Domestic Abuse:
- Physical violence
- Controlling behaviour (money, movements, friends)
- Emotional abuse (put-downs, threats)
- Sexual coercion
- Isolation from support

### Supporting Someone in Domestic Abuse:
- Believe them
- Don't pressure them to leave
- Help them access support safely
- Recognise leaving is dangerous
- Refer to specialist services

### Specialist Services:
- **National Domestic Abuse Helpline**: 0808 2000 247
- **Respect (for perpetrators)**: 0808 802 4040
- **CALM (male victims)**: 0800 585858

---

## Looking After Yourself

Hearing disclosures can be distressing.

- Use Radio Check supervision
- Don't carry it alone
- Practice self-care
- Know that you did the right thing by reporting

## Diversity and Inclusion in Peer Support

The veteran community is diverse. Effective peer support means being able to connect with and support veterans from all backgrounds. This module explores how to provide inclusive support.

---

## The Diverse Veteran Community

Veterans come from all backgrounds:

### Protected Characteristics:
- Age
- Disability
- Gender reassignment
- Marriage/civil partnership
- Pregnancy/maternity
- Race and ethnicity
- Religion or belief
- Sex
- Sexual orientation

### Additionally:
- Different service branches
- Different conflicts/eras
- Regular vs reserve
- Different ranks
- Different lengths of service
- Different reasons for leaving

---

## Why Diversity Matters

### Everyone Deserves Equal Support
Every veteran deserves quality peer support, regardless of who they are.

### Different Experiences, Different Needs
- A female veteran's experience differs from a male veteran's
- An LGBTQ+ veteran may have faced specific challenges
- Veterans of colour may experience racism in civilian life
- Disabled veterans face additional barriers

### Better Outcomes
Research shows that inclusive services lead to better outcomes for all.

---

## Common Barriers for Diverse Veterans

### Female Veterans:
- Services designed around male experience
- Experiences in military not always validated
- MST (Military Sexual Trauma)
- Caring responsibilities
- Not feeling like "real" veterans

### LGBTQ+ Veterans:
- Historical discrimination ("Don't Ask, Don't Tell", pre-2000 ban)
- Fear of judgment
- Specific mental health impacts
- Lack of representation

### Veterans of Colour:
- Racism in military and civilian life
- Cultural barriers to seeking help
- Underrepresentation in services
- Immigration issues for Commonwealth veterans

### Disabled Veterans:
- Physical access barriers
- Assumptions about capability
- Comorbid mental health
- Navigating multiple services

---

## Inclusive Practice

### Language Matters
- Use language the person uses for themselves
- Don't make assumptions about gender or relationships
- Ask how someone wants to be addressed
- Avoid stereotypes

### Avoid Assumptions
- Don't assume someone's experiences based on how they look
- Everyone's service was valid
- All veterans count, regardless of deployment

### Check Your Biases
We all have unconscious biases. Be aware of yours:
- Do you make different assumptions about different groups?
- Do you relate more easily to people similar to you?
- Are there groups you know less about?

### Make Space for Different Experiences
- Some people may not feel like "real" veterans - validate them
- Different conflicts have different experiences
- Not all trauma looks the same

---

## Supporting Specific Groups

### Female Veterans:
- Recognise women's service
- Be aware of MST (don't probe, but be prepared)
- Don't make sexist comments or jokes
- Recognise their veteran identity

### LGBTQ+ Veterans:
- Use inclusive language
- Don't make assumptions about relationships
- Recognise historical discrimination
- Create a safe, accepting space

### Veterans of Colour:
- Acknowledge racism exists
- Don't minimise racial experiences
- Be culturally sensitive
- Check your own biases

### Older Veterans:
- Recognise different era experiences
- May have different attitudes to mental health
- Value their service

---

## Intersectionality

People can belong to multiple groups, facing combined challenges.

**Example:** A Black female veteran may face:
- Racism AND sexism
- Military Sexual Trauma
- Not being seen as a "real" veteran
- Cultural barriers to seeking help

Recognise the whole person, not just one aspect of their identity.

---

## Creating Inclusive Environments

### Physical:
- Accessible venues
- Quiet spaces available
- Gender-neutral toilets where possible

### Atmosphere:
- Welcoming to all
- No discrimination tolerated
- Diverse representation in materials

### Online:
- Accessible websites
- Inclusive language
- Moderated to prevent discrimination

---

## What to Do If You Witness Discrimination

### Within Radio Check:
- Challenge inappropriate comments (if safe to do so)
- Report to supervisors
- Support the person affected
- Don't ignore it

### From Outside:
- Support the veteran
- Help them access appropriate support
- Report hate crimes if appropriate

### What is Signposting?
Helping someone find the right services and support. You don't need to know everything - just how to help them find what they need.

### How to Signpost:
1. **Listen** to understand what they need
2. **Ask** what kind of help they're looking for
3. **Suggest** relevant services
4. **Offer** to help them contact services if needed
5. **Follow up** to see how they got on

### Helpful Phrases:
- "There's a service that might help with that..."
- "Have you heard of...?"
- "Would it help if we looked at that together?"
- "Would you like me to find the number for you?"

## Case Studies and Scenarios

This module presents realistic scenarios you might encounter as a Radio Check Peer Supporter. Use these to test and consolidate your learning.

---

## How to Use This Module

For each scenario:
1. Read the situation carefully
2. Think about what you would do
3. Consider the key issues
4. Check the suggested approach
5. Reflect on what you learned

---

## Scenario 1: Dave - Depression and Isolation

### The Situation:
Dave, 58, left the Army after 22 years. He's been struggling since retirement 5 years ago. He contacts you saying he "just needs someone to talk to". During the conversation, he mentions:
- He rarely leaves the house
- His wife left him last year
- He's drinking more than he used to
- He doesn't see the point in anything anymore
- He sometimes thinks "everyone would be better off without me"

### Key Issues:
- Possible depression
- Social isolation
- Alcohol concerns
- Concerning statement about others being better off (potential suicide ideation)

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Listen and validate**: "It sounds like you've been going through a really difficult time"
2. **Explore the concerning statement**: "You mentioned people being better off without you. Can you tell me more about that?"
3. **Ask directly about suicide**: "Are you having thoughts of ending your life?"
4. **Assess risk level**
5. **Encourage professional help**: GP, Op Courage
6. **Discuss reducing alcohol**
7. **Signpost to services**: Veterans Gateway, Combat Stress
8. **Agree follow-up**

---

## Scenario 2: Sarah - PTSD and Anger

### The Situation:
Sarah served in Afghanistan as a medic. She's having nightmares and flashbacks to treating casualties. She says:
- She's angry all the time and has pushed her friends away
- Loud noises make her "jump out of her skin"
- She avoids anything that reminds her of Afghanistan
- She sometimes dissociates - "it's like I'm not in my body"
- She's tried talking to her GP but they "don't understand military stuff"

### Key Issues:
- Clear PTSD symptoms
- Anger and relationship impact
- Previous negative experience with services
- Possible dissociation

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Acknowledge and validate**: "What you're describing sounds really difficult. Many veterans who've experienced what you did struggle with similar things"
2. **Normalise**: "These are common responses to trauma"
3. **Encourage specialist help**: "There are services that specialise in veterans"
4. **Signpost**: Op Courage, Combat Stress (PTSD specialists)
5. **If she dissociates**: Use grounding techniques
6. **Don't push for trauma details**
7. **Discuss self-care**: What helps her feel calmer?

---

## Scenario 3: Marcus - Crisis

### The Situation:
Marcus calls you sounding distressed. He says:
- He's just found out his wife is having an affair
- He's got a bottle of pills in front of him
- He's "going to end it tonight"
- He's been drinking
- He says "Don't tell anyone - just listen"

### Key Issues:
- **CRISIS SITUATION**
- Has means (pills), plan (tonight), and intent
- Alcohol involved (increases risk)
- Asking for confidentiality

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Stay calm**: Your calm helps him
2. **DON'T promise confidentiality**: "I care about you and I can't promise that when I'm worried about your safety"
3. **Keep him talking**: Build rapport
4. **Ask him to move the pills away**: "Can you put the pills in another room?"
5. **Assess**: Is he alone? Can you get someone there?
6. **Call for help**: While keeping him on the line if possible - 999 or NHS 111 Option 2
7. **Stay with him**: Until help arrives

**This requires immediate action - you cannot handle this alone.**

---

## Scenario 4: Emma - Disclosures

### The Situation:
Emma, a veteran, tells you:
- Her partner has been controlling her money and who she sees
- He sometimes gets physical when he's angry
- She's scared of him but doesn't want to leave
- She asks you not to tell anyone
- She has a 6-year-old daughter

### Key Issues:
- Domestic abuse (physical, financial, emotional)
- Safeguarding concern (child in the household)
- Request for confidentiality
- Safety planning

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Listen and believe**: "Thank you for trusting me with this. I believe you"
2. **Acknowledge difficulty**: "That sounds really frightening"
3. **Explain limits**: "I can't promise confidentiality when there's safety concerns, especially with a child involved"
4. **Don't pressure her to leave**: Leaving is dangerous
5. **Report**: Contact supervisor - safeguarding concern
6. **Signpost safely**: National Domestic Abuse Helpline
7. **Safety plan**: What to do if danger increases
8. **Support her choices**: She's the expert in her own safety

## Scenario 5: James - Boundaries

### The Situation:
You've been supporting James for 3 months. Lately:
- He's messaging you multiple times a day
- He wants to meet socially as "mates"
- He gets upset when you can't respond immediately
- He says you're the only person who understands him
- He's stopped seeing his GP because "you're enough"

### Key Issues:
- Dependency developing
- Boundary issues
- He's stopped accessing professional help
- Unhealthy attachment

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Recognise the signs**: This is dependency developing
2. **Gently address it**: "I've noticed we've been in contact a lot more. I'm wondering how we can make sure you've got support from more than just me"
3. **Reinforce boundaries**: "I care about you, but I can only respond during our agreed times"
4. **Encourage other supports**: Who else can he talk to?
5. **Professional help**: "It would really help if you could see your GP again"
6. **Discuss in supervision**: Get support managing this
7. **Be consistent**: Maintain boundaries kindly but firmly

---

## Scenario 6: Cultural Sensitivity

### The Situation:
Ahmed is a British Army veteran who served 15 years. He's Muslim and mentions:
- He struggled with the perception of Muslims in the military
- He feels caught between two worlds
- His family don't understand his veteran identity
- He's experiencing depression
- He's fasting for Ramadan, which is affecting his energy

### Key Issues:
- Intersection of multiple identities
- Cultural considerations
- Depression
- Religious practice

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Validate both identities**: His veteran identity AND cultural identity are valid
2. **Don't make assumptions**: Ask how he'd like to be supported
3. **Respect religious practice**: Be aware of Ramadan
4. **Address mental health**: Depression needs support regardless of background
5. **Signpost inclusively**: Consider if services are culturally appropriate
6. **Check your biases**: Are you making any assumptions?

---

After reviewing these scenarios:
1. What was most challenging?
2. Were there any situations you felt unprepared for?
3. What would you do differently in practice?
4. What additional support do you need?
