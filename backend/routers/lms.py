## What is Mental Health?

Mental health is a state of wellbeing in which an individual:
- Realises their own abilities
- Can cope with normal stresses of life
- Can work productively
- Can contribute to their community

**Mental health is not simply the absence of mental illness.** We all have mental health, just as we all have physical health.

## Mental Health vs Mental Illness

| Mental Health | Mental Illness |
|---------------|----------------|
| How we think, feel, and cope | A diagnosable condition |
| Fluctuates day to day | Requires professional treatment |
| Affected by life events | Has specific symptoms |
| Everyone has it | Affects 1 in 4 people |

## Veteran Mental Health Statistics

- **1 in 5** veterans experience depression, anxiety, or PTSD
- Veterans are **2-3x more likely** to experience depression than civilians
- **Average of 2 veteran suicides per week** in the UK
- Only **50%** of veterans with mental health issues seek help

## Barriers to Seeking Help

Veterans face unique barriers:
- **Stigma**: "Real soldiers don't need help"
- **Pride**: Self-reliance trained into them
- **Distrust**: Of non-military services
- **Identity**: Admitting struggle feels like weakness
- **Access**: Not knowing what's available

## The Role of Peer Support

As a peer supporter, you are NOT a therapist. You are:
- A listening ear
- Someone who understands military life
- A bridge to professional services
- A fellow veteran who gets it

**Your role is to SUPPORT, not to FIX.**

## The ALGEE Action Plan

ALGEE is the core framework for Mental Health First Aid. It provides a structured approach to helping someone experiencing mental health difficulties.

### A - Approach, Assess, Assist

**Approach** the person appropriately:
- Choose a suitable time and place
- Respect their privacy
- Be calm and patient

**Assess** for risk of suicide or harm:
- Look for warning signs
- Ask directly if concerned
- Take all threats seriously

**Assist** with any crisis:
- If immediate danger, call 999
- Stay with them
- Follow safeguarding protocols

### L - Listen Non-judgmentally

- Give your full attention
- Don't interrupt
- Accept what they say without judging
- Use open body language
- Reflect back what you hear
- Avoid giving advice too quickly

**DON'T SAY:**
- "You should..."
- "At least..."
- "I know how you feel"
- "Cheer up"
- "Others have it worse"

**DO SAY:**
- "I'm here for you"
- "That sounds really difficult"
- "Tell me more about that"
- "How are you coping with this?"

### G - Give Reassurance and Information

- Reassure them they've done the right thing by talking
- Remind them that help is available
- Share information about mental health when appropriate
- Don't minimise their experience
- Don't make promises you can't keep

### E - Encourage Appropriate Professional Help

Help them understand professional options:
- GP (first point of contact)
- NHS 111 Option 2 (mental health crisis)
- Op Courage (NHS veteran service)
- Combat Stress
- Private therapy

**How to encourage help-seeking:**
- Normalise it: "Lots of people find talking to someone helpful"
- Remove barriers: "I can help you find a number"
- Offer support: "Would you like me to be there when you call?"

### E - Encourage Self-Help and Other Supports

- Exercise and physical activity
- Connecting with others
- Routine and structure
- Limiting alcohol
- Peer support groups
- Hobbies and interests

**Remember: You are encouraging, not prescribing.**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL MODULE - 100% Pass Required

This module covers essential ethical boundaries. You must pass with 100% to continue.

## What Peer Support IS and IS NOT

### Peer Support IS:
- Listening without judgment
- Sharing your own experience (when appropriate)
- Signposting to professional services
- Providing emotional support
- Being a consistent, reliable presence
- Following safeguarding protocols

### Peer Support IS NOT:
- Therapy or counselling
- Diagnosing conditions
- Prescribing treatments or strategies
- Giving medical advice
- A substitute for professional help
- Available 24/7 at all times

## Boundaries of Competence

**You are competent to:**
- Listen and validate feelings
- Share information about resources
- Recognise warning signs
- Follow escalation procedures
- Refer to professionals

**You are NOT competent to:**
- Diagnose mental health conditions
- Provide therapy techniques (CBT, EMDR, etc.)
- Advise on medication
- Make decisions for the person
- Guarantee outcomes

## Confidentiality and Its Limits

**What you keep confidential:**
- Personal details shared with you
- The content of conversations
- Their contact information

**When confidentiality MUST be broken:**
- Immediate risk of suicide
- Risk of harm to others
- Disclosure of abuse (especially involving children)
- Serious crime disclosure
- Court order requiring disclosure

**Always inform:** "What you tell me is confidential, unless I'm worried about your safety or someone else's safety."

## Avoiding Dependency

Signs someone is becoming dependent:
- Only wants to talk to you
- Contacting you outside agreed times
- Expecting you to solve their problems
- Getting upset if you're unavailable

How to manage:
- Set clear boundaries from the start
- Encourage professional support
- Rotate peer supporters if possible
- Discuss with your supervisor

## Power Dynamics

Remember:
- You are in a position of trust
- The person may be vulnerable
- Your words carry weight
- Don't exploit this position

**Never:**
- Start a romantic relationship with someone you support
- Accept gifts of significant value
- Share personal contact details
- Meet outside agreed settings without approval

## Self-Disclosure Guidelines

Sharing your own experience CAN be helpful if:
- It's brief and relevant
- It normalises their experience
- It doesn't shift focus to you
- It's not competitive ("mine was worse")

**Good example:** "I've had times when everything felt overwhelming too. What helped me was talking to someone."

**Bad example:** "Oh, I had PTSD for 10 years and let me tell you about everything that happened to me..."

## Documentation

You MUST record:
- Date and time of contact
- Summary of key concerns
- Any safeguarding issues
- Actions taken
- Referrals made

This protects you AND the person you're supporting.

## Active Listening

Active listening is MORE than just hearing words. It involves:

### 1. Full Attention
- Put away distractions
- Maintain eye contact (in person) or focus (online)
- Don't plan what you'll say next
- Be present in the moment

### 2. Body Language
- Open posture
- Nodding to show understanding
- Leaning slightly forward
- Facial expressions that match the conversation

### 3. Verbal Encouragers
- "Mm-hmm"
- "I see"
- "Go on"
- "Tell me more"

## Open vs Closed Questions

### Open Questions (USE THESE)
Start with: What, How, Tell me about...
- "How are you feeling about that?"
- "What's been on your mind?"
- "Tell me more about what happened"

### Closed Questions (USE SPARINGLY)
Get yes/no answers:
- "Are you okay?" → Often gets "I'm fine"
- "Did that upset you?" → Yes/No

## Reflective Listening

Reflecting back what you hear shows you're listening and helps clarify.

**Simple Reflection:** Repeat key words
- Person: "I just feel so tired all the time"
- You: "You're feeling tired..."

**Paraphrasing:** Restate in your own words
- Person: "My wife doesn't understand what I went through"
- You: "It sounds like you feel there's a gap between your experiences and hers"

**Reflecting Feelings:** Name the emotion
- Person: "I don't know why I bother anymore"
- You: "It sounds like you might be feeling hopeless"

## Empathic Responses

**Empathy is NOT:**
- Fixing the problem
- Comparing experiences
- Giving advice immediately
- Saying "I know how you feel"

**Empathy IS:**
- Acknowledging their feelings
- Validating their experience
- Being present without judgment

**Examples:**
- "That sounds really difficult"
- "I can hear how much this is affecting you"
- "It makes sense that you'd feel that way"
- "Thank you for trusting me with this"

## What NOT to Say

❌ **Dismissive:**
- "You'll be fine"
- "Just think positive"
- "Others have it worse"
- "Snap out of it"

❌ **Judgmental:**
- "Why didn't you..."
- "You should have..."
- "That was silly"

❌ **Competitive:**
- "I had it worse when..."
- "At least you didn't..."

❌ **False Reassurance:**
- "Everything will be okay"
- "I promise it will get better"

## Handling Silence

Silence is okay! It can mean:
- They're processing
- They're gathering courage
- They need a moment

**Don't:**
- Rush to fill it
- Get uncomfortable
- Change the subject

**Do:**
- Sit with it
- Give them space
- Offer gentle prompts: "Take your time"
