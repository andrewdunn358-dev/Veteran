## Core Architecture
```
/app
├── admin-site/          # Vanilla JS admin portal (20i hosting)
├── backend/             # FastAPI backend (Render)

## What's Been Implemented (March 2026)

### Session: March 7, 2026
**Safari/iPhone Onboarding Fixes**
- Fixed Age Gate modal not working on iPhones - replaced HTML `<select>` with iOS-friendly FlatList pickers
- Fixed cookie consent being cut off on Safari/small viewports - converted to compact inline banner
- Fixed permissions modal being cut off - made more compact with maxHeight constraint
- Added ScrollView wrapper to Age Gate modal for scrolling on small screens
- All modals now fit within Safari's smaller viewport on desktop and mobile

Files changed:
- `frontend/src/components/AgeGateModal.tsx` - iOS-friendly pickers, ScrollView, compact styles
- `frontend/app/index.tsx` - Compact cookie banner, compact permissions modal

### Session: March 6, 2026
**Location Permission on First Load**
- Modified `index.tsx` to include location permission alongside microphone in the "Enable Permissions" modal
- Created `LocationPermissionContext.tsx` to track and provide location permission state
- Location permission is now requested during initial app onboarding

**In-Page Safeguarding Call Modal**
- Created `SafeguardingCallModal.tsx` - full WebRTC call experience in a modal
- Updated `chat/[characterId].tsx` and `unified-chat.tsx` to use in-page call modal
- Users no longer redirect to `/peer-support` - call happens on chat page
- GPS location is requested and sent to backend when call is initiated

**Desktop Responsive Layout**
- `ResponsiveWrapper.tsx` provides centered mobile view with side-panel branding
- Left panel: Radio Check logo, feature list
- Center: Phone-framed app content
- Right panel: Emergency contact numbers
