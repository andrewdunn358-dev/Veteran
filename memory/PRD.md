# Radio Check - Mental Health Veterans Support Platform

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Version 3.1 | March 2026**

---

## Original Problem Statement

Build "Radio Check," a mental health and peer support application for veterans. The project includes a React web application, a Python FastAPI backend, and web portals for Admin and Staff. The core goal is to provide immediate, reliable real-time support (audio calls and text chat) to users.

### Service Definition
Radio Check is a clinically governed early-intervention and safeguarding platform designed to:
- Provide immediate human connection
- Detect escalating risk early
- Stabilise distress
- Triage appropriately
- Bridge users into the right external services

**We are NOT:** A therapy provider, crisis emergency service, or replacement for NHS/statutory services.
**We ARE:** The structured bridge between isolation and formal support.

### 2. Risk Detection & Monitoring

### 3. Short-Term Stabilisation

- Crisis coping tools

### 4. Referral & Bridging
