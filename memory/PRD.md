# Radio Check - Mental Health & Peer Support for Veterans

## Original Problem Statement
Build "Radio Check," a mental health and peer support application for veterans. Key requirements:
- Staff rota/calendar system with shift swap capabilities
- Content Management System (CMS) for app content editing
- Multi-layered safeguarding system for user chat monitoring
- WebRTC and live chat for user-to-staff communication
- Distinct AI personas for peer support

## Current Architecture

```

## Mobile App Architecture (WebView Approach)

When staff/admin login to the mobile app:
```
Login → Check Role
├── role = 'user'      → Native veteran screens (home, AI chat, etc.)
├── role = 'counsellor'/'peer' → WebView loads staff.radiocheck.me
└── role = 'admin'     → WebView loads admin.radiocheck.me
```

**Benefits:**
- Single app for veterans and staff
- Reuses existing portal code
- Auto-login via token injection
- Native header with refresh/logout

## New Call/Chat Flow (Fixed)

**Problem**: Staff was seeing safeguarding alerts BEFORE user was ready to receive calls/chats.

**Solution**: Alerts now only appear when user is connected and ready:

### Call Flow:
1. Safeguarding triggers → modal shows to user
2. User clicks "Call a Supporter" → navigates to peer-support
3. User registers with WebRTC (waits for connection)
4. `request_human_call` emitted to notify staff
5. Staff sees call request banner → clicks "Call Now"
6. User receives incoming call → clicks Accept
7. WebRTC connection establishes

### Chat Flow:
1. Safeguarding triggers → modal shows to user
2. User clicks "Chat with a Supporter" → navigates to live-chat
3. User's `request_human_chat` emits to notify staff
4. Staff sees chat request banner → clicks "Accept"
5. Chat room created → both parties join

## What's Been Implemented

### Session - February 27, 2025 (Latest - COMPREHENSIVE FIX)

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS COMPLETE:**

The call connection was failing because of a **call_id mismatch**:
1. Staff portal generates local `call_id` in `makeOutboundCall()`: `call_xxx_localTimestamp`
2. Backend generates DIFFERENT `call_id` in `call_initiate`: `call_xxx_serverTimestamp`
3. Backend sends `call_accepted` with server's `call_id`
4. Staff portal's `call_accepted` handler was NOT updating `currentCallId`
5. Staff sends `webrtc_offer` with WRONG `call_id`
6. Backend can't find the call → **offer silently dropped**
7. User never receives offer → **call hangs on "Connecting"**

**COMPREHENSIVE FIXES APPLIED:**

1. **CRITICAL FIX in `webrtc-phone.js` - `call_accepted` handler:**
   - Now updates `currentCallId` from `data.call_id` (server's authoritative ID)
   - This ensures WebRTC signaling uses the correct call ID

2. **Added `call_ringing` handler** in `webrtc-phone.js`:
   - Also updates `currentCallId` as a backup sync point

3. **Added `webrtc_error` event handler** in `webrtc-phone.js`:
   - Shows meaningful error message when WebRTC signaling fails

4. **Enhanced `webrtc_offer` handler in backend:**
   - Now logs all active call IDs when a mismatch occurs
   - Emits `webrtc_error` back to sender so they know the offer failed
   - Checks if target is still connected before forwarding

5. **Fixed chat room collection** in `accept_chat_request`:
   - Was inserting into `db.chat_rooms`
   - Now inserts into `db.live_chat_rooms` AND `live_chat_rooms` dict
   - Matches the API endpoints in `server.py`

6. **Improved socket initialization** in `useWebRTCCallWeb.ts`:
   - Now fully recreates socket if disconnected (was just reconnecting without re-attaching listeners)

7. **Improved socket wait logic** in `peer-support.tsx`:
   - Now polls every 500ms until socket is confirmed connected
   - Was using fixed 2s timeout which could fail on slow connections

**Key Files Modified:**
- `staff-portal/webrtc-phone.js` - call_id sync fix, error handling
- `staff-portal/app.js` - Added logging for chat acceptance flow
- `frontend/hooks/useWebRTCCallWeb.ts` - Socket reconnection fix, logging
- `frontend/app/peer-support.tsx` - Socket wait polling
- `backend/webrtc_signaling.py` - Error handling, logging, chat room fix

### Session - February 26, 2025 (Previous)

**Session - February 27, 2025 - Chat Fix Continuation:**

**Chat Fix Applied:**
1. **User ID mismatch in chat flow** - User was registering with `userId` but sending chat request with `sessionId`. Fixed `live-chat.tsx` to register with `sessionId || userId` for consistency.
2. **Chat room collection fix** - Already fixed in earlier commit, room now created in `live_chat_rooms` collection.
3. **Added `chat_request_expired` handler** - Staff portal now shows notification when chat request expires (user disconnected).
4. **Removed "Chat with User" button from safeguarding alerts** - As requested, since chat requires user to initiate first.

**Key Files Modified:**
- `staff-portal/app.js` - Removed chat buttons from safeguarding alerts, added `chat_request_expired` handler
- `frontend/app/live-chat.tsx` - Fixed user registration ID mismatch
- `backend/server.py` - Added better logging and fallback for `/live-chat/rooms/{room_id}/join` API

**Bug Fixes:**
1. **Chat banner timing** - Added 1.5s delay before showing generic chat banner to allow safeguarding alerts to load first
2. **Messages disappearing in chat** - Fixed by disabling polling when Socket.IO is connected (set `socketChatConnected` flag)
3. **Call from safeguarding alert not working** - Fixed by checking `window.pendingChatRequest.user_id` first (which has the actual Socket.IO user ID), instead of using the AI chat session ID
4. **Incoming call UI missing** - Added Accept/Reject buttons for incoming calls on the user's waiting screen

**New Features:**
1. **"Waiting for Support" Screen** - When user clicks "Call a Supporter", they see a waiting screen with:
   - Pulsing phone icon
   - Status messages that update over time
   - Option to switch to text chat
   - Cancel button
2. **Incoming Call UI** - Users now see "Accept" and "Decline" buttons when staff calls them
3. **Call Button in Chat Modal** - Staff can escalate from text chat to voice call without leaving the chat

**Safeguarding Flow - Phase 2 Complete:**
- ✅ Added `data-session-id` attribute to safeguarding alert cards in staff portal
- ✅ Created `acceptPendingChatFromAlert` function for accepting chats from alert cards
- ✅ Updated frontend chat screens (`chat/[characterId].tsx`, `unified-chat.tsx`) to pass `sessionId` and `alertId` when navigating to live-chat or peer-support
- ✅ Updated `live-chat.tsx` to include `session_id` in `request_human_chat` socket emit
- ✅ Updated backend `webrtc_signaling.py` to include `session_id` in `incoming_chat_request` events sent to staff
- ✅ Added CSS for `.user-request-indicator` component in `staff-portal/styles.css`
- ✅ User registers with WebRTC when waiting for call - staff can now call them directly

**Key Files Modified:**
- `staff-portal/app.js` - renderSafeguardingAlerts, setupLiveChatRequestListeners, acceptPendingChatFromAlert, initiateStaffCall, joinChatRoomSocket, leaveChatRoomSocket, startChatPolling, callUserFromChat
- `staff-portal/styles.css` - Added user-request-indicator CSS, call button styling
- `frontend/app/peer-support.tsx` - Waiting for support screen, incoming call Accept/Reject UI
- `frontend/app/chat/[characterId].tsx` - handleConnectToStaff passes sessionId
- `frontend/app/unified-chat.tsx` - handleConnectToStaff passes sessionId
- `frontend/app/live-chat.tsx` - requestHumanChat includes session_id
- `backend/webrtc_signaling.py` - request_human_chat handler includes session_id

### Previous Session - February 26, 2025

**WebRTC Audio Fix:**
- Added ExpressTURN credentials (user's account)
- TURN relay candidates now being generated
- Audio calls working both directions

**Safeguarding Popup Redesign (Phase 1):**
- New 2-button design: "Call a Supporter" OR "Chat with a Supporter"
- "Request a Callback" as secondary option
- Updated both chat screens (unified-chat.tsx, chat/[characterId].tsx)

**Staff Portal Improvements:**
- initiateStaffCall tries session ID directly
- staff_chat_invite Socket.IO handler added
- Web Audio API ringtone (UK double-ring pattern)

**Local Assets:**
- All avatar images moved to /public/images/
- Updated all paths from /assets/images/ to /images/
- Images: tommy, doris, bob, finch, margie, hugo, rita, catherine

## Current TURN Server Config
```javascript
// ExpressTURN - user's account

    urls: 'turn:free.expressturn.com:3478',
    username: '000000002087494108',
    credential: 'VGqVfeznpN8ZxyueC6MSG71Sso8='
