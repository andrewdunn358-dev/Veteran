## What's Been Implemented (March 2026)

### Session: March 8, 2026 - Evening (Latest)

**CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Secure Learner Authentication**

- Learners must now set a password after admin approval
- bcrypt password hashing for secure storage
- JWT tokens for session management (7-day expiry)

**New Backend Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/lms/learner/login` - Email + password login
- `POST /api/lms/learner/set-password` - Set password after approval
- `GET /api/lms/learner/check-status/{email}` - Check if password is set
- `GET /api/lms/admin/module/{module_id}` - Full module details with quiz

**LMS Admin Portal Improvements:**

## Pending Issues (P0-P2)

### P0 - Critical
- **RESOLVED (March 8, 2026)**: Learner registration was insecure (email-only, no password) - Fixed by implementing password-based authentication with bcrypt hashing and JWT tokens
- **Deployment Verification**: User needs to deploy latest files to 20i hosting:
  - `/app/lms-admin/index.html`
  - `/app/lms-learner/index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css`

### P1 - High Priority  
- AI Character sort order not respecting `order` field from database
- End-to-end testing of Community Events flow (Admin creates → User joins Jitsi)

### P2 - Medium Priority
- End-to-end testing of admin reporting features (PDF export/email)
- Full regression testing of safeguarding call flow
- Consolidate vanilla JS portals into single React app (tech debt)

## Future Tasks
- Rewrite admin-site, staff-portal, lms-admin, lms-learner from vanilla JS to React
- LMS Discussion Forums
- Enhanced safeguarding ("Anthony's code" features)
- Mood Tracker Journal
- Appointment Booking, Secure Messaging, CBT courses
- Welsh Language Support

## Third-Party Integrations
- Twilio: WebRTC and phone calling
- OpenAI gpt-4o-mini: AI chat personas
- Resend: Email notifications (LMS approval/rejection)
- Leaflet.js: Location maps
- fpdf2: PDF generation
