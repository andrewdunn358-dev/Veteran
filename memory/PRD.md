# Radio Check - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build "Radio Check," a mental health and peer support application for veterans and serving personnel. The project includes:
- React web application (Vercel)
- Python FastAPI backend (Render)
- Vanilla JS web portals for Admin and Staff (20i hosting)
- **NEW: LMS for volunteer training (20i hosting)**

## CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT NOTES

### DO NOT ADD TO requirements.txt:
- `emergentintegrations` - This is an Emergent preview-only package. It does NOT work on Render/production. NEVER add it to requirements.txt even if pip freeze includes it.

### Production Deployment:
- Backend: Render
- Frontend (mobile app): Vercel  
- Static portals (admin-site, staff-portal, lms-admin, lms-learner): 20i hosting

## What's Been Implemented (March 2026)

### Session: March 14, 2026 - AI Safety Classifier & Local Storage (LATEST)

**MAJOR: AI-Enhanced Semantic Safety Classifier**

Added OpenAI GPT-4o-mini as a secondary safety layer for deeper semantic analysis of messages that rule-based detection might miss.

1. **AI Classification Layer (NEW)**
   - Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini via Emergent Universal Key
   - Classifies messages as: none, low, medium, high, imminent
   - Analyzes conversation context (last 10-20 messages)
   - Only invoked selectively (when thresholds triggered) to save cost/latency
   - AI can UPGRADE risk levels, but never downgrade from high/imminent
   - Caching for recent classifications (5 min TTL)

2. **Selective Invocation Rules**
   - Rule-based score >= 30
   - Keywords triggered
   - Semantic similarity >= 0.5
   - Concerning patterns detected
   - Conversation escalating

3. **New Files:**
   - `backend/safety/ai_safety_classifier.py` - Full AI classifier implementation

4. **New Endpoint:**
   - `POST /api/safety/generate-summary` - Generate AI session summaries

**MAJOR: Local Conversation Storage**

Store last 50 messages on user's device for cross-session context and AI memory.

1. **Frontend Storage Service:**
   - `frontend/src/services/conversationStorage.ts`
   - Stores 50 messages per character
   - AI-generated session summaries
   - Privacy controls (opt-out, delete, export)
   - Risk flags from previous sessions

2. **Features:**
   - Full transcripts (50 messages per character)
   - AI-generated summaries (key topics, emotional state, risk flags)
   - Feeds into safeguarding for cross-session monitoring
   - User can view/delete their history
   - User can opt-out entirely

**UI Improvements:**

1. **Home Page Redesigned:**
   - 2-column grid of square cards (instead of horizontal)
   - Logo properly centered at top
   - Matches reference design

2. **Live Chat Cleaned Up:**
   - Reduced header buttons (one back button, call button, more options)
   - Consolidated Report/Block/End Chat into single modal
   - Cleaner, more modern appearance

**Bug Fixes:**

1. **Call/Chat Status:**
   - Added `force_available` Socket.IO event
   - Auto-reset stuck staff statuses
   - Fixed socket reference issues

2. **Deployment:**
   - Removed emergentintegrations from requirements.txt

### Session: March 14, 2026 - Unified Safeguarding System Overhaul

**MAJOR: Conversation Trajectory Analysis & Semantic Detection**

Implemented comprehensive safeguarding system that evaluates the ENTIRE conversation trajectory, not just single messages. This upgrade combines:

1. **Full Conversation Monitoring (Section 1 & 6)**
   - Rolling 50-message history per session
   - Tracks risk scores, categories, patterns across messages
   - Calculates conversation-level risk combining all signals

2. **Pattern Detection Engine (Section 2)**
   - EMOTIONAL_DECLINE: distress → hopelessness → ideation
   - METHOD_INTRODUCTION: distress + method mention
   - INTENT_ESCALATION: ideation → intent
   - FINALITY_BEHAVIOR: finality + intent/method
   - BURDEN_TO_IDEATION: burden → ideation

3. **Semantic Similarity Model (Section 3)**
   - sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
   - Detects suicidal intent even without exact keyword matches
   - Cosine similarity comparison against reference embeddings
   - Thresholds: HIGH (0.80), MEDIUM (0.70), LOW (0.60)

4. **Large Phrase Dataset (Section 4)**
   - **527 phrases** across 14 categories (exceeds 500+ requirement)
   - Categories: distress, hopelessness, passive_death_wish, ideation, method, intent, finality, self_harm, burden, isolation, veteran, uk_colloquial, emotional, relationship_loss
   - UK-specific phrases and veteran/military terminology

5. **Continuous Phrase Learning (Section 5)**
   - Candidate phrases flagged for human moderation
   - High-risk messages without keyword matches queued for review
   - No automatic unsupervised inclusion

6. **Safety Failsafe Rules (Section 7)**
   - Explicit suicide plan → IMMINENT
   - Imminent intent statement → IMMINENT
   - High semantic similarity to suicide → IMMINENT
   - Rapid escalation with method → IMMINENT
   - Intent confirmation pattern → IMMINENT

7. **Performance (Section 8)**
   - Average analysis time: 35.5ms (target <50ms) ✓

8. **Audit Logging (Section 9)**
   - All safety assessments logged with full context
   - Session ID, user ID, message preview, risk scores, patterns, trends
   - Filterable by time window and minimum risk level

9. **Compatibility (Section 10)**
   - Integrated with existing EnhancedSafetyLayer
   - Integrated with existing SafetyMonitor
   - No breaking changes to AI chat endpoint

**New Backend Files:**
- `backend/safety/__init__.py` - Module exports
- `backend/safety/conversation_monitor.py` - Conversation trajectory tracking
- `backend/safety/phrase_dataset.py` - 527 categorized phrases
- `backend/safety/semantic_model.py` - Semantic similarity analysis
- `backend/safety/unified_safety.py` - Orchestrates all safety layers
- `backend/safety/crisis_resources.py` - Location-aware crisis resources

**New API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/safety/debug` - System status (phrases, model, sessions)
- `GET /api/safety/audit` - Safety audit report with filtering

**Component Weights:**
- Keyword detection: 30%
- Conversation trajectory: 35%
- Semantic similarity: 25%
- Pattern bonus: 10%

**Test Coverage:**
- `backend/tests/test_unified_safeguarding.py` - 16 unit tests, 100% pass
