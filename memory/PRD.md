# Radio Check - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build "Radio Check," a mental health and peer support application for veterans and serving personnel. The project includes:
- React web application (Vercel)
- Python FastAPI backend (Render)
- Vanilla JS web portals for Admin and Staff (20i hosting)

## Core Architecture
```
/app
├── admin-site/          # Vanilla JS admin portal (20i hosting)
├── backend/             # FastAPI backend (Render)
├── frontend/            # React/Expo frontend (Vercel)
└── staff-portal/        # Vanilla JS staff portal (20i hosting)
```

## What's Been Implemented (March 2026)

### Session: March 7, 2026
**iPhone Age Gate Bug Fix**
- Fixed Age Verification modal not working on iPhones
- Replaced HTML `<select>` elements with custom iOS-friendly bottom-sheet picker modals
- Used FlatList with TouchableOpacity options for smooth scrolling on iOS
- All date fields (Day, Month, Year) now use the new PickerModal component
- File changed: `frontend/src/components/AgeGateModal.tsx`

### Session: March 6, 2026
**Location Permission on First Load**
- Modified `index.tsx` to include location permission alongside microphone in the "Enable Permissions" modal
- Created `LocationPermissionContext.tsx` to track and provide location permission state
- Location permission is now requested during initial app onboarding

**In-Page Safeguarding Call Modal**
- Created `SafeguardingCallModal.tsx` - full WebRTC call experience in a modal
- Updated `chat/[characterId].tsx` and `unified-chat.tsx` to use in-page call modal
- Users no longer redirect to `/peer-support` - call happens on chat page
- GPS location is requested and sent to backend when call is initiated

**Desktop Responsive Layout**
- `ResponsiveWrapper.tsx` provides centered mobile view with side-panel branding
- Left panel: Radio Check logo, feature list
- Center: Phone-framed app content
- Right panel: Emergency contact numbers

### Previous Session Work
- WebRTC Safeguarding Call Flow (Fixed)

- `/admin/clear-logs` - POST to clear test logs
- Socket.IO events for WebRTC signaling

## Pending Issues (P0-P2)
