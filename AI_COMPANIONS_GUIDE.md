# AI Companions - What You Need to Know

## Overview

Radio Check uses AI companions to provide immediate, confidential support for UK military veterans. Our AI companions are here to listen, not to replace human support.

**Important:** Our AI companions are not human. They cannot provide therapy, medical advice, or legal counsel. They are designed to be a friendly first point of contact and to help connect you with real human support when needed.

## Meet the Team

### Tommy & Doris - Your Battle Buddies

Tommy and Doris are AI companions designed to have a chat when you need someone to listen.

**Tommy** is like a calm, steady mate who's been around the block. He speaks plain, keeps things simple, and knows when to just listen.

**Doris** is warm and grounded - the kind of person you'd sit down with over a brew. She's a good listener with a bit of dry wit when the moment's right.

### Sentry - Legal Information Companion

Sentry provides general information about UK legal processes that may affect veterans. He focuses on helping you understand how systems work, not on telling you what to do.

## Understanding the Difference

| Human Support | AI Companions |
|---------------|---------------|
| Can provide therapy | Can only listen and chat |
| Can give medical advice | Cannot give any advice |
| Can assess your situation | Can only reflect what you share |
| Can make referrals | Can only suggest you speak to someone |
| Has lived experience | Has no experience - just trained responses |

**Our AI companions bridge the gap** - they're there for you at 3am when you need to talk, and they help you reach the human support you might need.

## Sentry - Legal Information Only

Sentry is specifically designed for veterans dealing with legal matters like historical investigations, compensation claims, or MOD decisions.

### What Sentry Will Do

- Explain how schemes like AFCS and War Pension work in general terms
- Describe what to typically expect from legal processes
- Help you understand your general rights
- Explain when people usually seek a solicitor

### What Sentry Won't Do

- Tell you what to do about your specific case
- Say whether anyone was right or wrong
- Help you "fight" or "challenge" anyone
- Draft any documents
- Replace proper legal advice

### Example

**You ask:** "My AFCS claim was rejected. What should I do?"

**Sentry says:** "I can explain how the AFCS review and appeal process generally works, but I can't advise on your specific situation. Would you like me to outline the general process, or explain when people typically seek advice from a solicitor?"

---

## Our Commitment

1. **Honesty** - Our AI companions will never pretend to be human
2. **Safety** - They are trained to recognise distress and encourage human support
3. **Privacy** - Your conversations stay on your device
4. **Respect** - They understand military culture and speak your language
5. **Boundaries** - They know what they can and can't do, and they'll tell you

## Questions?

If you have questions about how our AI companions work, please contact us through the app or speak to one of our human team members.

**Remember:** Tommy, Doris, and Sentry are here to support you - but they're not a replacement for the brilliant human support that's also available through Radio Check.
